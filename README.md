# Trello Clone

## Overview

This Project is used to get basic weather data from Open Weather Map and display that data using React dynamically. This appplication can search by city, zip code or latitude and longitude.

## Technologies

This project is built on React with javascript. I have intergrated bootstrap as a css library.

## Going Forward

I would like to have this application be able to get historical data and maybe incorperate multiple api's to allow the user to get more robust weather data.
